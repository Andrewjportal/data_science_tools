# Instructor Notes

This lecture is a general introduction to NOSQL. It should be given before the mongodb lab. Go through this relatively
quickly. It is important that students get to see that there are multiple NOSQL databases, and get a high level overview
of the motivation, but it is worth delaying detailed questions about why we would do this until _after_ they have some
experience using Mongo.

This lesson is also unusual in that there are no exercises. This is not in keeping with our lesson guidelines. In many senses
this lesson is really part of the mongo-lab exercise. This notebook may be merged with that one eventually, but has been kept
separate for now to allow the flexibility to offer this lecture a day earlier (to make scheduling more flexible).
