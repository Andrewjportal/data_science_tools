# Sample Lesson Plan

- (60m) [Slide deck](SVD_PCA.pdf)

# Learning Objectives

Students should be able to
* Apply decomposition methods to situations that require dimensionality reduction.
  * Make an informed decision about the number of principle components to use.
* Explain the benefits and limits of PCA.
* Be familiar enough with the math behind SVD/PCA to review on their own time.
* Explain the role of variance in PCA.


# Instructor Notes

## Revision Notes

This lesson follows the NLP overview (high level NLP topics and specific tools like Bag of Words) and the Curse of Dimensionality lesson.

This lesson is meant to lead up to Topic Modeling (essentially decomposition for NLP) and, later, Recommendation Systems.
