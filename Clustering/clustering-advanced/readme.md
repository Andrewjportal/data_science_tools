# Sample Lesson Plan

# Learning Objectives

Students can
* Compare and contrast different clustering algorithms in terms of
  * Complexity/Scalability
  * Typical application
  * Hyperparameters (including, most importantly, if K is a hyperparameter or not)
  * Algorithmic gist (ie, students might not be able to whiteboard or code each algorithm but could give a verbal explanation of how each works).

## Revision Notes

The goal of this lesson is to give students a picture of the context of different clustering algorithms. The below image from the sklearn docs [original](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/clustering.html#overview-of-clustering-methods) [code to generate](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/cluster/plot_cluster_comparison.html) is a good example of the kind of overview I'm imagining.

This lesson includes elbow plots and other advanced clustering techniques.

It should include hands on demonstrations in a notebook and (possibly) a slide deck the instructor revising sees fit.
