# Sample Lesson

# Sample Lesson Plan

- (40m) [Introduction to Clustering](clustering_kmeans_intro.pptx)

# Learning Objectives

Students can
* Outline an unsupervised project that uses clustering to group related observations.
* Explain measures of clustering performance (inertia and silhouette coefficient)
  * Explain how these measures can be used to choose `k`, the number of clusters.
* Whiteboard the k-means algorithm.

# Depends On


# Instructor notes

For k-means, this lesson focuses on the theory and uses a toy example to illustrate key concepts. The accompanying lab [KMeansClustering.ipynb] offers hands-on experience with k-means using more realistic data.

The (PPT) [clustering_kmeans_intro.pptx] includes instructor notes with explanations of the slides.
